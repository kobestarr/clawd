## Key Findings

### LinkedIn Ad Library Notes
- Agentforce keyword shows mostly Bluprintx's own content (expected - niche keyword)
- Broader keywords needed for competitor research
- LinkedIn only shows company logos, not full ad creatives
- Screenshot capture implemented for visual ad content

### Reddit Ads API Progress
- Documentation: https://ads-api.reddit.com/docs/v3/

  - Scopes: adsread,adsconversions,history,adsedit,read
- **OAuth flow completed:**
  - Authorization code: dnDbgpIbF-CiJRhcGzIT5DcYPYU4pg
  - Access token obtained: eyJhbG... (expires in 86400s)
  - Token saved to: ~/.clawdbot/reddit/token.json
- **Next step:** Find ad account ID from https://ads.reddit.com
- Scripts created:
  - `/root/clawd/reddit-test.js` - Credentials test
  - `/root/clawd/reddit-find-account.js` - Account finder
  - `/root/clawd/reddit-api.js` - Main API client (needs account ID)

## Files Created
- `/root/clawd/ad-intel/` - Main project
- `/root/clawd/ad-intel/config/projects/bluprintx.json` - Project config
- `/root/clawd/ad-intel/screenshots/` - Local screenshots
- `/usr/lib/node_modules/clawdbot/skills/google-drive/` - Google Drive skill
- `/root/clawd/reddit-test.js` - Credentials test
- `/root/clawd/reddit-find-account.js` - Account finder
- `/root/clawd/ad-creator/` - **NEW: Ad Creative Generation Engine**
  - `ad-creator.js` - Main engine
  - `example.js` - Example run (240 combinations)
  - `README.md` - Documentation

## Today's Progress - Ad Creative Engine

### What We Built
- **Ad Creative Generation Engine** at `/root/clawd/ad-creator/`
- Fetches images from Google Drive folder
- Fetches text variations from Google Sheets
- Generates all combinations automatically

### Example Output
- 4 images × 5 headlines × 4 CTAs × 3 descriptions = **240 variations**
- Output format ready for Reddit Ads API

### Usage
```bash
cd /root/clawd/ad-creator
node ad-creator.js \
  --drive-folder "Bluprintx/Ads/Images" \
  --sheet-id "YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID"
```

### Google Sheets Format
Create tabs: "Headlines", "CTAs", "Descriptions" (one variant per row, first column)

### Next Steps
- ⏳ Test with real Drive/Sheets data
- Build Reddit API upload integration (when API is approved)
- Add image variation features (crop, resize, overlay)

## TODOs / Next Steps
- Test Reddit Ads API with active ad account
- Build image variation generator for ad testing
- Create text combination engine for A/B testing
- Scale up competitor research with more keywords
